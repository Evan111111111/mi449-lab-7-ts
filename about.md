    <h2>GPT-4o</h2>
    <p>I started this project by using GPT-4o to add alpine.js, alpine fetch, and tailwind to my layout file. It had no problem doing this and was easily able to edit the code on it's own. After that I asked it to insert the fetch line from the JSON placeholder website which again was done on the first try. After this is where i began to encounter issues using the gpt-4o model. When I asked it to display the endpoints on my main html page it was not able to do this right away. For example, I asked it to style my endpoint boxes with the prompt: "style the two endpoints using tailwind so they appear in two seperate boxes with a different color from the background". the response was a basic white container with random color text. Besides that GPT-4o was as useful model that had a few issues but for this project performed ok.</p>

    <h2>Gemini</h2>
    <p>After completing just over half of this project using GPT-4o I decided to switch to another model. At first I tried to use claude but it was not capable of simply changing the color behind a paragraph of text. After two failed attempts I decided to switch to gemini. I was surprised with how effective gemini was because of how accurate it turned out to be. I rarely had to ask twice to get working code and the comments it provided were good too. I used gemini to clean up a few design issues on my homepage and fix an issue I was having with the home and about buttons. I also used it to fix issues that GPT-4o and claude could not. The problem I was having while styling my JSON endpoints was easily solved with the prompt: "edit this code so the text is all black and the background of the container is a light yellow". It was able to generate a response that fixed my problem on the first try. After using gemini for the rest of my project it appeared to perform better than GPT-4o and claude.</p>
